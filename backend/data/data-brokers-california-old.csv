We help our clients identify people who might be interested in their marketing offers. Sometimes our research is intended to help our clients find new donors or customers, others to find new ways to serve or connect with existing donors or customers. But whether they are our clients, the American consumer, or others, we care about people, and provide consumers with privacy choices.

We do not currently make consumer information publicly available via a website or other online service, nor do we currently host public websites where other consumers could post this information.  Accordingly, we do not have a specific method for submitting the requests described in this section.  Please see www.Wiland.com/Privacy-Choices for more information about our products and services, how we use and protect consumer personal information and how consumers can exercise their privacy choices.","We use consumer data for the purpose of creating products and services intended to help consumers receive relevant marketing offers and to reduce marketing waste and unwanted advertising. We require our clients to use our products only for marketing related activities, and not for sensitive decisions like credit, employment or housing. In addition, we limit the type of data we receive and the type of data we share in the interest of consumer privacy. We don’t possess or utilize sensitive data like credit card or bank account numbers, Social Security Numbers or other government-issued identifiers. We do not accept or generate information specifying individuals’ health conditions (such as protected health information, aka “HIPAA data”) and do not seek to predict that any person has a particular health condition.

We do not knowingly collect information about consumers residing in other locations (such as Europe) or about children.

We belong to several industry groups such as the Data and Marketing Association division of the ANA and the Digital Advertising Alliance. One reason these self-regulatory groups exist is to ensure that companies commit to honoring consumer choice.

We may also collect Data through sever-to-server integrations or other Application Program Interfaces (“API”’s). The integration will enable Freckle to collect data from third-party devices present at certain third-party locations. Such devices may use Wi-Fi, near field communication (“NFC”), or Bluetooth low-energy (“BLE”) beacon technology to transmit signals about the location of Devices to us.  Once Freckle obtains this Information, it will transmit that data though an API, in encrypted form, via a HTTPS protocol to its data management platform, make inferences (the “Inferences”), as defined below, about the Device user’s interests.

Freckle uses “pixel tags” and/or “cookies” in order to provide reporting on ad delivery in a pseudonymous manner. Pixel tags are small bits of code that provide delivery information on a webpage. This allows the operator of the page or a third party to collect the IP address of the users of the page. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the browser of a computer that uniquely identify the browser and provide information to the cookie sender. Many websites send cookies to the browsers that are visiting those sites, and many browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. Users can change the browser settings to refuse cookies or to alert them when a cookie has been placed on their browser. The user can check the browser for details in this regard.

Freckle engages in cross device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related.
